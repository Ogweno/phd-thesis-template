Greece is located on the boundary of convergence of three tectonic plates, making it the most active tectonic and seismic area in Europe. The complexity of the tectonic background makes the region a natural laboratory, study of tectonic phenomena such as strong earthquakes and intense deformations. As a result, there is a lot of scientific work that has been carried out to better identify the deformation field in Greece.
